# C++ DSA Practice and LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal C++ solutions for various data structures and algorithms problems. It includes LeetCode challenges, sorting algorithms, and daily practice files organized by days.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `Data_structure/`  
  Contains implementations and notes on fundamental data structures.

- `Day_11/` to `Day_15/`  
  Daily logs and code for problem-solving practice. Includes topics such as:
  - Stock buy-sell problem
  - Binary search
  - Pointer and variable insights

- `LeetCode/`  
  Solutions to selected LeetCode problems.

- `SortingAlgo/`  
  Various sorting algorithm implementations.

## üìÑ Important Files

- `3SumProblem.cpp`  
  Solves the classic **3Sum** problem.

- `3SumProblem.exe`, `3sum.cpp`  
  Binary and source files for linked list and 3Sum practice problems.

- `69_SQRT.cpp`  
  Solution for the problem of computing the square root using binary search logic (LeetCode Problem #69).

- `69_SQRT.exe`  
  Compiled executable for the above problem.

## üìú Commit Highlights

- Solved key algorithmic problems like binary search, stock span, single element in an array.
- Learned deep concepts of pointers and memory management.
- Daily progress tracked and committed with meaningful messages.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Compile any `.cpp` file using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## üß† Goal

To improve my C++ skills and problem-solving ability through consistent DSA and LeetCode practice.
